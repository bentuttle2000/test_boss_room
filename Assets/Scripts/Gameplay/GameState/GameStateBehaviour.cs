    /// <summary>
    /// A special kind of NetworkBehaviour that represents a discrete game state. The special feature it offers is
    /// that it provides some guarantees that only one such GameState will be running at a time.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// Q: what is the relationship between a GameState and a Scene?
    /// A: There is a 1-to-many relationship between states and scenes. That is, every scene corresponds to exactly one state,
    ///    but a single state can exist in multiple scenes.
    /// Q: How do state transitions happen?
    /// A: They are driven implicitly by calling NetworkManager.SceneManager.LoadScene in server code. This is
    ///    important, because if state transitions were driven separately from scene transitions, then states that cared what
    ///    scene they ran in would need to carefully synchronize their logic to scene loads.
    /// Q: How many GameStateBehaviours are there?
    /// A: Exactly one on the server and one on the client (on the host a server and client GameStateBehaviour will run concurrently, as
    ///    with other networked prefabs).
    /// Q: If these are MonoBehaviours, how do you have a single state that persists across multiple scenes?
    /// A: Set your Persists property to true. If you transition to another scene that has the same gamestate, the
    ///    current GameState object will live on, and the version in the new scene will self destroy to make room for it.
    ///
    /// Important Note: We assume that every Scene has a GameState object. If not, then it's possible that a Persisting game state
    /// will outlast its lifetime (as there is no successor state to clean it up).
